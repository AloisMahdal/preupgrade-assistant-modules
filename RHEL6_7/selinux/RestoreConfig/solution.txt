Custom SELinux configuration options managed by the semanage command are lost after the upgrade. This module stores the custom configuration options, restores them once the upgrade is complete, and issues the SELinux relabel mechanism upon the next reboot to accommodate the possible changes that might have been raised by these modifications. No manual user action is necessary upon upgrade.
