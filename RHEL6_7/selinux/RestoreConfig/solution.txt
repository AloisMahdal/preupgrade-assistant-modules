Custom SELinux configuration options managed by semanage command are lost after upgrade. This preupgrade assistant content stores the custom configuration options, restores them once the upgrade is complete and issues the SELinux relabel mechanism upon the next reboot to accomodate the possible changes that might have been raised by these modifications. No manual user action is necessary upon upgrade.
