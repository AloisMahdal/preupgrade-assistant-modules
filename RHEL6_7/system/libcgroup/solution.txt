In previous versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, system administrators built
custom cgroup hierarchies with the use of the cgconfig command from the libcgroup
package. This package is now deprecated.

Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 moves the resource management settings from the
process level to the application level by binding the cgroup hierarchy
with the systemd unit hierarchy. Therefore, you can manage the cgroup tree
with systemctl commands.
