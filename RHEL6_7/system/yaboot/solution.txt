The module is valid only on 64-bit PowerPC architecture and it checks if Yaboot is installed.

Yaboot cannot boot Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7. Redhat-upgrade-tool will install GRUB 2 during the upgrade. Create the /etc/default/grub file before running redhat-upgrade-tool to ensure a correct GRUB 2 configuration. Misconfiguration can make the system unbootable.

The /etc/default/grub file has been created for this system. Kernel command-line options were converted to a new Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 format and moved into /etc/default/grub.
