The module is valid only on the 64-bit PowerPC architecture and it checks if Yaboot is installed.

Yaboot cannot boot the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 system. Red Hat Upgrade Tool will install GRUB 2 during the upgrade. Create the /etc/default/grub file before running `redhat-upgrade-tool` to ensure the correct GRUB 2 configuration. A misconfiguration might make the system unbootable.
