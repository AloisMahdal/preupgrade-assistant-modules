In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, the CGROUP_DAEMON option can be used in any of the files in the /etc/sysconfig/ directory to specify a list of control groups that the daemon will be run in. For example, CGROUP_DAEMON="cpu:daemons cpuacct:/" will run it in the daemons group for the CPU controller, and in the '/' group for the CPU accounting controller.
We cannot automatically port this to systemd-based Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7. For more information, see [link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html-single/Resource_Management_Guide/index.html]
