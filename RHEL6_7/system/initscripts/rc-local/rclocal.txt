It is highly advisable to create your own systemd services or udev rules
to run scripts after boot instead of using this file.

In constrast to previous versions, due to parallel execution during boot 
this script will NOT be run after all the other services.
  
Run 'chmod +x /etc/rc.d/rc.local' to ensure
that this script will be executed during boot.
