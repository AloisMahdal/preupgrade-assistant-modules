If there are any removable media listed in /etc/fstab, it is necessary to add "nofail" flag to each one of them. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 will fail to boot if the medium is not present and "nofail" is not specified. It is not possible to check this automatically with 100% confidence. Please check your /etc/fstab.
