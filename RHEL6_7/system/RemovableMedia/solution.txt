If there are any removable devices listed in the /etc/fstab file, it is necessary to add the 'nofail' flag to each one of them. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 will fail to boot if the device is not present and 'nofail' is not specified. It is not possible to verify this automatically with full confidence, so check your /etc/fstab file.
