Debuginfo packages are required for easier debugging of the application run
and crashes. These need to have the same version as the rpm for which they
provide the debuginfo information.

As the debuginfo packages are located in the different repository than
application packages you need to provide the additional repository
to the redhat-upgrade-tool if you want to have the debuginfo packages
updated. Without updating them these are useless after the upgrade.

To make them updated add [bold:--addrepo debuginfoupg=<path to the repository with debuginfo>] to the redhat-upgrade-tool syntax.

After the upgrade, you may need to install additional debuginfo packages
brought in by new dependencies. If your policy requires to have all
debuginfos installed, you will need to do this manually after the in-place
upgrade.
