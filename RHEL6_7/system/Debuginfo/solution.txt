Debuginfo packages are required for easier debugging of the application run
and crashes. These need to have the same version as the RPM for which they
provide the debuginfo information.
As the debuginfo packages are located in a different repository than
application packages, provide the additional repository
to the redhat-upgrade-tool to have the debuginfo packages
updated. The packages that are not updated cannot be used after the upgrade.
To make them updated, add '--addrepo debuginfoupg=<path to the repository with debuginfo>' to the redhat-upgrade-tool syntax.
After the upgrade, you might need to install additional debuginfo packages
brought in by new dependencies. If your policy requires to have all
debuginfos installed, do this manually after the in-place
upgrade.
