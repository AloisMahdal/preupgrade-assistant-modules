[preupgrade]
content_title = CA bundles 
content_description = Later versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux include a shared store for certificate authorities (CA). The module informs that any additional trusted CA must be placed in a new location, and that you should not modify the distributed CA bundles. The Preupgrade Assistant cannot automatically identify how CA bundles have been modified on your system.
