Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 includes a shared store for certificate authorities.
You can find out more information about this shared store by reading the
following manual page on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.x system:

 `$ man update-ca-trust`

In previous versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, modifying the distributed certificate bundles
(such as the /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.trust.crt file) was a way of adding
an additional trusted certificate authority to the system.
These additional trusted certificate authorities must be ported forward to
the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 system manually. Place them as certificate (PEM or DER)
files to the /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/ directory, and then type:

 `# update-ca-trust`

Read the update-ca-trust manual page for more information.
