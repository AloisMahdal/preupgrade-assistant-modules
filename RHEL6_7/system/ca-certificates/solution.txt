Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.0 and later include a shared store for certificate authorities.
You can find out more information about this shared store by reading the
following manual page on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.x system:

 $ man update-ca-trust

In previous versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux modifying the distributed certificate bundles
(such as /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.trust.crt) was defacto the way of adding
an additional trusted certificate authority to the system.

These additional trusted certificate authorities must be ported forward to
the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.0 system manually. Place them as certificate (PEM or DER)
files to the following directory:

 /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors

and then run the following command

 # update-ca-trust

Read the update-ca-trust manual page for more information.
