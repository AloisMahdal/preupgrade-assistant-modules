The module stores custom tuned profiles located at /etc/tune-profiles to POSTUPGRADE_DIR.

After the upgrade to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, the profile can be migrated manually with the help of commands 
tuned-man and tuned-profiles to the /etc/tuned/ directory.
There is also a web page which describes tuned at [link:http://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/20/html/Power_Management_Guide/tuned.html].
