The module stores the custom 'tuned' profiles, which are located in the /etc/tune-profiles/ directory, to POSTUPGRADE_DIR.

After the upgrade to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, the profiles can be migrated manually with the help of the `tuned-man` and `tuned-profiles` commands to the /etc/tuned/ directory.
For more information about 'tuned', see [link:http://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/20/html/Power_Management_Guide/tuned.html].
