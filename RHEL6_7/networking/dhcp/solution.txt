The files "/etc/sysconfig/[dhcpd|dhcpd6|dhcrelay]" used for specifying the user's 
customization arguments are deprecated in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7. Instead, these arguments can
be specified in the "[dhcpd|dhcpd6|dhcrelay].service" files on the "ExecStart" line.

The specified arguments are automatically moved from /etc/sysconfig/*
files into *.service files the during upgrade. Verify that they are moved
correctly and everything works as expected.
