Some issues have been found in your BIND9 configuration.
Use following solutions to fix them:


'tcp-listen-queue' statement with value less than '10':
-------------------------------------------------------
The value specified in 'tcp-listen-queue' statement is less than '10'.
You should:
- Change your configuration to use at least value of '10'. BIND9
  will silently ignore value < '10' and use '10' instead.


'zone-statistics' arguments changed:
------------------------------------
Arguments of 'zone-statistics' option changed in new version of BIND9.
You should:
- Replace argument 'yes' with 'full', or replace argument 'no' with
  'terse'. Old options are still recognised by BIND9 and silently
  converted.


slave zone definition without 'masterfile-format' statement:
------------------------------------------------------------
In new version of BIND9, slave zones are saved by default as 'raw'
format after the zone transfer. Previously the default format was 'text'.
You should use one of the following solutions:
- Remove saved slave zones files so they are saved in the 'raw'
  format when transfered next time.
- Convert zones files to 'raw' format using the 'named-compilezone'
  tool.
- Include 'masterfile-format text;' statement in the slave zone
  definition statement.


Zone declaration that conflicts with built-in empty zones:
----------------------------------------------------------
In new version of BIND9, the list of automatically created empty
zones expanded. Your configuration contains zone that is conflicting
with built-in empty zone. You should use one of following solutions:
- Disable the specific empty zone by using 'disable-empty-zone <zone>;
  statement
- Disable empty zones at globally by using 'empty-zones-enable no;'
  statement.


[FIXED] No 'pid-file' AND/OR 'session-keyfile' statement found:
-------------------------------------------------------
The directory used by named for runtime data has been moved from the BIND
default location, '/var/run/named/', to a new location '/run/named/'.
As a result, the PID file has been moved from the default location
'/var/run/named/named.pid' to the new location '/run/named/named.pid'.
In addition, the session-key file has been moved to '/run/named/session.key'.
These locations need to be specified by statements in the options section.
To fix this we added:
- 'pid-file  "/run/named/named.pid";' statement into the options section of
  your BIND9 configuration.
- 'session-keyfile  "/run/named/session.key";' statement into the options
  section of your BIND9 configuration.


The config file(s) could not be fixed completely, there are still some issues that need review.


Written Fixed config file to '/root/preupgrade/dirtyconf/etc/named.conf'
