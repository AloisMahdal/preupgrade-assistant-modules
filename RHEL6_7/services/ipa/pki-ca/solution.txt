Identity, Policy and Audit (IPA) installations that use a Certificate Authority (CA) provided by the pki-ca package are not able to be upgraded in-place between Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7. This module verifies whether there is an IPA CA installed, in which case you need to upgrade the IPA installation manually.

For detailed instructions on how to upgrade an IPA installation, please refer to the following Knowledge Base article: [link:https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/894063]
