Identity, Policy and Audit (IPA) installations that use a Certificate Authority (CA) provided by the pki-ca package are not able to be in-place upgraded between Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7. This module verifies whether an IPA CA is installed, in which case you need to upgrade the IPA installation manually.

For detailed instructions on how to upgrade the IPA installation, see [link:https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/894063].
