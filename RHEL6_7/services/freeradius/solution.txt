Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 contains the FreeRADIUS service version 3.x, which is a major version upgrade from version 2.x in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6. 

The configuration of the FreeRADIUS service version 3.x is not compatible with version 2.x. There are no automated mechanisms to convert a FreeRADIUS 2.x configuration into a FreeRADIUS 3.x configuration, therefore the conversion must be performed manually by an experienced administrator.
 
You are advised to install the default FreeRADIUS configuration and make incremental changes while testing each minor alteration. Placing the FreeRADIUS configuration files located in the /etc/raddb/ directory under version control is recommended. Using a source code management (SCM) tool, such as Git or Apache Subversion, enables you to track changes over time.

Available resources for performing the upgrade include:

* The files located in the /usr/share/doc/freeradius*/ directories. Many of these documents are installed by the freeradius-doc subpackage. It is recommended that you install this package.

* The FreeRADIUS man pages, especially unlang(5), and radiusd.conf(5). To see a list of available man pages, type `man -k radius`.

* The in-line comments located within the configuration files in the /etc/raddb/ directory. This is where the majority of the FreeRADIUS documentation can be found, and it is important to read the contents of the configuration files.

* The upstream website [link:http://freeradius.org] and especially the wiki located at [link:wiki.freeradius.org]

* The FreeRADIUS users mailing list available at [link:http://lists.freeradius.org/mailman/listinfo/freeradius-users]
