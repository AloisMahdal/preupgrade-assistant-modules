Some packages installed on your system have broken upgrade path from Red Hat
Enterprise Linux version 6 to version 7 (the version of package is lower in
newer Enterprise Linux).

This does not cause fail of redhat-upgrade-tool run and it could
potentially left system in inconsistent state (mixed RHEL 6 and RHEL 7
packages installed).  Pre-upgrade scripts makes best effort to force
redhat-upgrade-tool in-place upgrade process install packages with broken
upgrade path but you should be aware of that and know what is happening.

Optionally, if possible, you may remove packages in question from RHEL 6
system.
