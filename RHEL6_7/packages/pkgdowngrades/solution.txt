Some packages installed on your system have a broken upgrade path from Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 6 to version 7 (that is, the version of the package is lower in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7).
This causes a failure of redhat-upgrade-tool run, and it might leave the system in an inconsistent state with mixed Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 packages installed. Preupgrade scripts make the best effort to force the redhat-upgrade-tool in-place upgrade process to install the packages with a broken upgrade path, but you should be aware of that.
Optionally, if possible, remove the packages in question from your Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 system.
