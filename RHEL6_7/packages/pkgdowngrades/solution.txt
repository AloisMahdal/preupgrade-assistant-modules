Some packages installed on your system have a broken upgrade path from Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 (that is, the version of the package is lower in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7).
This situation might cause a failure of the redhat-upgrade-tool run, which in turn might leave the target system in an inconsistent state, with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 packages mixed together. The Preupgrade Assistant installs a plug-in for the Red Hat Upgrade Tool to mitigate this risk, so now the Red Hat Upgrade Tool should migrate even the packages with a broken upgrade path. Check that everything is as expected after the upgrade. Optionally, if possible, remove the packages with a broken upgrade path from your Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 system.
