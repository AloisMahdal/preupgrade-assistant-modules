The service name for qemu-guest-agent was modified in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 from qemu-ga to qemu-guest-agent. Modify the scripts that use the original service name.

The main hook script location was modified in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 from /usr/libexec/qemu-ga/fsfreeze-hook to /etc/qemu-ga/fsfreeze-hook.

The app-specific hook script directory location was modified in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 from /usr/libexec/qemu-ga/fsfreeze-hook.d to the following three locations listed in the decreasing order of precedence:
/run/qemu-ga/fsfreeze-hook.d
/etc/qemu-ga/fsfreeze-hook.d
/lib/qemu-ga/fsfreeze-hook.d

The format of the guest agent configuration file /etc/sysconfig/qemu-ga was modified in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 from the shell script to the systemd environment file. Only the 'BLACKLIST_RPC' and 'FSFREEZE_HOOK_PATHNAME' options remain valid. The 'FSFREEZE_HOOK_ENABLE' option was merged with the 'FSFREEZE_HOOK_PATHNAME' settings. The port settings for virtio-serial were moved to the /usr/lib/systemd/system/qemu-guest-agent.service and /usr/lib/udev/rules.d/99-qemu-guest-agent.rules files. The systemd daemon must be reloaded with the 'systemctl daemon-reload' command in order to apply the changes. The option for the PID file was removed because with the systemd daemon, PID files are no longer needed. The option for the log file was removed because the systemd journal is used for logging purposes.

Note the new locations of all the files and configuration options, and update your scripts that use their original locations accordingly.
