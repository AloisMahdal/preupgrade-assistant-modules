The taskjuggler and taskjuggler-libs packages are not available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7. Upstream stopped support for taskjuggler 2
( as the rewrite to QT 4 is not an easy task) and taskjuggler 3 written
in ruby is not compatible.

Unfortunately, there is no replacement supported by Red Hat. If your processes
require these packages, you may either compile the kdelibs 3 and kdepim 3
stack (bringing QT3 stuff into RHEL 7) or migrate to taskjuggler 3 (from
upstream, www.taskjuggler.org).
