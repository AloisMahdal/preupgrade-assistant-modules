Packages not signed with the official Red Hat keys will not be upgraded. These packages are typically provided by third parties or have been modified in some way. There is a high risk of incompatibility with these packages as they have not been verified by Red Hat. For the upgrade assistance, contact the vendors of these packages.

You can find a list of all unsigned packages including their vendors' names in the [link:/root/preupgrade/kickstart/nonrhpkgs] file.
