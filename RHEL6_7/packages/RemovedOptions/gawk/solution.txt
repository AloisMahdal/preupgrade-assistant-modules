Some options were removed from the gawk package binaries between Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6
and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7. This might break the functionality of some of your scripts.
All option removals along with the solutions are listed below.

awk/gawk/pgawk: --compat option was removed, the alternative is
                  --traditional
                --copyleft option was removed, the alternative is
                  --copyright or -C
                --gen-po option was replaced by --gen-pot option
                --usage
                -D - the short form of --parsedebug was changed to -Y

Check that your scripts are aware of these changes.
