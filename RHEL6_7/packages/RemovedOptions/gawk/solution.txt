Some options were removed from the gawk package binaries between Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6
and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7. This might break the functionality of some of your scripts.
All option removals for awk, gawk, and pgawk, along with the solutions, are listed below:

- The '--compat' option was removed, the alternative is '--traditional'.
- The '--copyleft' option was removed, the alternative is '--copyright' or '-C'.
- The '--gen-po' option was replaced by the '--gen-pot' option.
- The '--usage' option was removed.
- The '-D' option, which was the short form of the '--parsedebug' option, was changed to '-Y'.

Verify that your scripts have been updated to work with these changes.
