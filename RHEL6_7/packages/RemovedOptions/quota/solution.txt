Some options were renamed or corrected at quota tools between Red Hat Enterprise Linux
6 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7. This might break the functionality of some of your scripts.

/usr/bin/quota: The '--nfs-all' option was corrected to '--all-nfs' in the usage help
output. Both versions still recognize the '--all-nfs' option.

/usr/sbin/quota_nld: The '--no-daemon' option was renamed to '--foreground'. The short
option '-F' is unchanged. This is not an issue if you run quota_nld as a daemon,
for example, via init script.

/usr/sbin/repquota: The '--batch-translation' option was corrected to '--cache' in the
usage help output. Both versions still recognize the '--cache' option.

/usr/sbin/repquota: The '--no-batch-translation' option was corrected to '--no-cache'
in the usage help output. Both versions still recognize the '--no-cache' option.

Check that your scripts are aware of these changes.
