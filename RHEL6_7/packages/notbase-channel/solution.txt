Either you have installed some packages from some of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6
Optional repositories on your system that are still available in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 
outside of Base repositories, or you have installed some packages
that have been moved from the Base to Optional repository in Red Hat Enterprise
Linux 7. This will very likely cause a failure during the upgrade of your system.
