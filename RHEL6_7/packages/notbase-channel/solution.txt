Either you have installed some packages from some of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6
'optional' repositories on your system which are still available on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7
system outside of 'base' repositories, or you have installed some packages
which have been moved from "base" to "optional" repository in Red Hat Enterprise
Linux 7.  This will very likely cause fail during upgrade of your system.
