"Some packages became obsolete between Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.
Red Hat provides alternatives for them, but these
alternatives might not be fully compatible. For this reason,
the packages are not replaced automatically.

For some of the obsolete packages you will get the
incompatibilities list from separate preupgrade
modules, and you can adjust your migration or upgrade
as required.

Sometimes the functionality of a package requires
more than one new package to achieve the same
functionality.

Note: All packages from the debug repositories
are skipped, and Red Hat recommends that you remove
them before the upgrade.

The following packages are obsolete, and they are replaced by
new ones:" >solution.txt
