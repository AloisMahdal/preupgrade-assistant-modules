Quota tool warnquota(8) has been moved from "quota" package into
"quota-warnquota" package.

If you used warnquota on the old system, please install quota-warnquota
package with this command on the new system:

# yum --assumeyes install quota-warnquota

Please do not forget to check warnquota configutation files
(/etc/quotagrpadmins, /etc/quotatab, and /etc/warnquota.conf) before using
the tool.

Please do not forget to install a cron job to execute the warnquota tool
periodically, if you used it on the the old system.
