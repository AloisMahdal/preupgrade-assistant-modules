The quota tool warnquota(8) has been moved from the quota package into the
quota-warnquota package.
If you used warnquota on the original system, install the quota-warnquota
package on the new system with the following command:

`# yum --assumeyes install quota-warnquota`

Do not forget to check the warnquota configuration files (/etc/quotagrpadmins, /etc/quotatab, and /etc/warnquota.conf) before using the tool.
Install a cron job to execute the warnquota tool periodically if you used it on the the original system.
