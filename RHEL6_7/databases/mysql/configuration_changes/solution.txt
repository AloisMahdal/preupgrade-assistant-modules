During the in-place upgrade, the old MySQL 5.1 RPM package is uninstalled and
the new MariaDB 5.5 RPM package is installed instead, but RPM does not take these
operations as an update. Note that the MySQL RPM renames /etc/my.cnf to
/etc/my.cnf.rpmsave on uninstall.

After installing MariaDB you should do the following to restore your old
configuration options:

  root> mv -vi /etc/my.cnf.rpmsave /etc/my.cnf
