Some packages do not track the possible performed changes to system configuration files; therefore, it cannot be easily determined if the files have been modified by the user or not. In order to allow for later examination, all configuration files not handled by the migration scripts are stored in the [link:dirtyconf/] directory. The list of the stored files is available in the [link:./kickstart/noverifycfg] file. Verify the functionality of the configuration files stored by this tool after a successful upgrade.
